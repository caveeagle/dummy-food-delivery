# Delivery Market Analysis

- Repository: `delivery-market-analysis`
- Duration: `4 days`
- Deadline: `02/01/2026 at 4PM`
- Team: `Solo or Team` 

## Mission Objectives

Enhance your data engineering and analytical skills by:
- Working with SQL operations like:
  - SELECT
  - JOIN
  - GROUP BY
  - Aggregations (e.g., average, sum)
  - Advanced queries
- Or working with PowerBI
- Exploring geospatial data analysis
- Extracting and visualizing insights from food delivery datasets
- Building data storytelling and presentation skills

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and query SQL database structures
- Optimize SQL queries for performance
- Visualize data insights using Python or PowerBI
- Deliver impactful presentations with data-driven narratives

## The Mission

> We are analyzing Delivery data to uncover actionable insights for restaurant partners and consumers. The objective is to explore trends, customer preferences, and market dynamics in the food delivery space.

Conduct exploratory analysis, summarize findings, and present actionable insights.

## Data
The database provided is structured as three SQLite files:

Start with the **Takeaway Database**, optionally, you can also work with the **Uber Eats Database** or **Deliveroo Database**.

### Database Schema

Refer to the database diagram for the schema. Use SQL queries to explore relationships between tables and derive insights.


## Must-have Features

Answer these key business questions:
1. What is the price distribution of menu items?
2. What is the distribution of restaurants per location?
3. Which are the top 10 pizza restaurants by rating?
4. Map locations offering kapsalons (or your favorite dish) and their average price.

Also answer these more open ended questions:

1. Which restaurants have the best price-to-rating ratio?
2. Where are the delivery ‘dead zones’—areas with minimal restaurant coverage?
3. How does the availability of vegetarian and vegan dishes vary by area?
4. Identify the **World Hummus Order (WHO)**; top 3 hummus serving restaurants.

Come up with at least 2 original questions!

## Nice-to-have Features

- Optimize SQL queries for speed and readability
- Suggest database schema improvements
- Add custom exploratory insights:
  - Compare cuisines' average ratings across platforms
  - Map high-density restaurant zones
  - Identify cuisine trends in different regions
- Visualize overlap of restaurant categories on different platforms
- Answer some questions across platforms:
  1. How do delivery fees vary across platforms and locations?
  2. How do ratings of similar restaurants differ across Uber Eats, Deliveroo, and Takeaway?

## Deliverables

1. **GitHub Repository:** Include all source code.
2. **Presentation:** Summarize findings in an engaging format (PDF or other).
3. On Friday, we will present 5-6 project! Each presenter will answer "Tell me about an project you've worked on", as if they were explaining it in an interview, using the [STAR method](https://resources.biginterview.com/behavioral-interviews/star-interview-method/). 

## Steps

1. Create the repository
2. Study the brief: Who? Why? What?
3. Identify technical challenges: How?
4. Explore and understand the dataset
5. Write and optimize SQL queries
6. Create visuals for each key question
7. Finalize and present results
